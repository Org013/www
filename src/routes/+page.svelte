	Hello world! I am ~~Gustavo L. de Mello~~ Guz,
	a software developer and generalist currently working on contributing and creating open-source software and libraries.

	Focusing and specializing in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)/[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
	and their ecosystems, while creating web and mobile applications for experience, fun and hopefully to be useful for someone.

	Using my own anxiety to loose sleep because of a mind that doesn't stop having ideas is how I work. And you can check out
	how this workflow is going on my social medias or on platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/Guz013) where most of the projects are public to anyone
	who wants to see the progress of them.

	Outside ~~loosing sleep because~~ of programming, I also create designs and logos said projects. And when not working on them I also enjoy
	creating art on any type of media, like drawings, pixelart, 3D, photography, etc. My photos can be found on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/guz013_)
	or [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/guz013), digital arts are on dedicated accounts.
